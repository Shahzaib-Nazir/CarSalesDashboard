<h1>USA Car Sales Dashboard</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
This project uses a large 500,000+ rows kaggle dataset of USA car sales from December 2014 - July 2015 giving insights to car sales by Manufacturers, State, Segment, Color, Seller and more using Power BI visualizations. First by cleaning the large data to remove any mass amount of missing column data or wrong entry data in columns, the data was transformed to add month and year columns for filtering. After cleaning the data was used to make visualizations with an App-like theme and multiple KPI's to convey relevant information. The dashboard has been made easy to understand for any type of user to filter it according to thier needs and grasp the trends while maintaining a polished and pleasing-to-look-at theme.
